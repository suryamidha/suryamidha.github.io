        <h3>Hi, I'm Surya.</h3>

        <p>My parents immigrated to the US from New Delhi, India. I was born in Mountain View and raised in San Jose, California.</p> 

        <p>I attended Bellarmine College Preparatory from 2017 to 2021 and spent most of high school thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate">policy debate</a>. My partner and I were the first team in history to win all three national tournaments in policy debate: the Tournament of Champions (TOC), the National Debate Coaches Association Tournament (NDCA), and the National Speech and Debate Association Tournament (NSDA). I was also individually ranked as the best speaker at both the TOC and NDCA.</p>

        <p>I graduated as salutatorian from Bellarmine in 2021 and matriculated to the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. I stumbled around for two years in a college <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsh_School_of_Foreign_Service#History">designed to train diplomats</a>, mostly taking courses in international relations, math, and economics.</p>
        
        <p>During college, I was an Assistant Debate Coach at Bellarmine, Intern to <a href="https://prasad.dyson.cornell.edu/">Eswar Prasad</a> in the  Global Economy and Development Program at the Brookings Institution, and Research Assistant to <a href="https://www.caitlintalmadge.com/">Caitlin Talmadge</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_studies">Security Studies</a> Program at Georgetown.</p>

        <p>I took academic leave in 2023 to co-found <a href="https://mercor.com">Mercor</a>, a labor aggregator, with my high-school friends <a href="https://x.com/adarsh_exe">Adarsh</a> and <a href="https://x.com/BrendanFoody">Brendan</a>. After bootstrapping the business to a seven-figure run rate, we raised a $3.6m seed round led by <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/portfolio/mercor">General Catalyst</a> and moved to San Francisco (after one unfortunate month in New York City).</p>

        <p>In March of 2024, I was named a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240320742346/en/Thiel-Foundation-Announces-Next-Thiel-Fellow-Class">Thiel Fellow</a>. In September, we announced our $30m <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/09/18/mercor-ai-interviewer-reaches-250-million-valuation/">Series A</a> at a $250m valuation led by Benchmark, with participation from General Catalyst, Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, Adam D'Angelo, and Larry Summers.</p>

        <p>In February of 2025, we announced our $100m <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/ai-startup-led-by-21-year-old-thiel-fellow-lands-2-billion-valuation?srnd=undefined">Series B</a> at a $2b valuation led by Felicis, with participation from General Catalyst, Benchmark, DST, and Menlo Ventures.</p>
        
        <p>I like <a href="tomfoolery/f1.jpg">f1</a>, <a href="tomfoolery/tea.jpeg">tea</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Vl41OxuAZM">coffee</a>, and <a href="tomfoolery/halloween.jpeg">halloween</a>—a holiday where pretending to be something you're not feels pleasantly relatable.</p>
